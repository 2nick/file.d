# Rename plugin
It renames the fields of the event. You can provide an unlimited number of config parameters. Each parameter handled as `cfg.FieldSelector`:`string`.
When `override` is set to `false`, the field won't be renamed in the case of field name collision.
Sequence of rename operations isn't guaranteed. Use different actions for prioritization.

**Example:**
```yaml
pipelines:
  example_pipeline:
    ...
    actions:
    - type: rename
      override: false
      my_object.field.subfield: new_sub_field
    ...
```

The resulting event could look like:
```yaml
{
  "my_object": {
    "field": {
      "new_sub_field":"value"
    }
  },
```
