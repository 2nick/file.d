# HTTP plugin
Reads events from HTTP requests with the body delimited by a new line.

Also, it emulates some protocols to allow receiving events from a wide range of software that use HTTP to transmit data.
E.g. `file.d` may pretend to be Elasticsearch allows clients to send events using Elasticsearch protocol.
So you can use Elasticsearch filebeat output plugin to send data to `file.d`.

> âš  Currently event commitment mechanism isn't implemented for this plugin.
> Plugin answers with HTTP code `OK 200` right after it has read all the request body.
> It doesn't wait until events are committed.
